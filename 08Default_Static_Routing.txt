Router Connections
-------------------
Here, for connecting two routers each other we have to use Serial DTE cable. Generally router's do not have Serial DTE cable ports. So, we need to plugin a module for router's to connect Serial DTE cable.
    1. Turn off your Router's
    2. Select HWIC-2T module from the MODULES sidebar
    3. Drag and drop the HWIC-2T module to the router
    4. Turn on your router
